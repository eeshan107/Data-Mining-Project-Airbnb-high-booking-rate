# 🌟 Airbnb Booking Rate Prediction: A Data Mining Odyssey 🌟

## 📊 Overview
Welcome aboard our voyage through the realm of data, where we harness the power of R and predictive modeling to illuminate the path to high booking rates on Airbnb.com. Our journey led us to an enchanted forest of algorithms, where Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Random Forest revealed secrets hidden within the data, culminating in an AUC of 0.83 and triumph in a predictive modeling contest.

## 🎯 Objective
Our quest was to unveil the mystic patterns that predict high booking rates, offering a beacon of insight for hosts to optimize their sanctuaries for travelers from across the realms.

## 🔮 Tools and Techniques
- **Language**: R, the ancient tongue of statisticians and sorcerers alike.
- **Models**: From the simple yet insightful Logistic Regression, through the mighty XGBoost, to the deep and wise Random Forest.
- **Success Metric**: The AUC, a measure of our prophecy's accuracy, reached the zenith at 0.83.

## 🚀 Journey to the Summit
1. **Data Wrangling**: Purifying the raw essence of data, and preparing it for the alchemy of analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Weaving powerful features, capturing the very soul of high booking rates.
3. **Model Training & Optimization**: Each model a step on the ladder, each parameter tuned to perfection.
4. **Victory**: Our spells of prediction conquered the contest with an AUC of 0.83 and an accuracy of 80%.
